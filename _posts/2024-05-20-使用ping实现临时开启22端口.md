# Using Ping as a Key to Temporarily Enable SSH:22 Port for Secure Remote SSH Access

When configuring firewall policies for SSH:22 access, we often set the server to accept connections only from a specific IP (such as a company IP). But what if you need to access the server while traveling or from home?

Common solutions include: 
1. Using a VPN to log in to the host.
2. Using a ping key to temporarily enable the remote host's SSH:22 port.

Today, we'll discuss the second solution and explain how to use a ping key to temporarily open SSH:22 access.

### Principle:
The `recent` module in iptables is a powerful tool that can track the IP addresses of recent visitors, and it is commonly used to implement DROP policies to mitigate syn-flood and DDoS attacks. However, in this example, we utilize the `recent` module in a different way by creating an ACCEPT policy. We set up an `sshKeyList` to track IP addresses that send specific ICMP echo request (ping) packets. When an IP address in this list reaches a predefined hit count within a specified time frame, the server allows that IP to access SSH:22. Our goal is to ensure that our current client's dynamic IP is recorded in this list. This can be achieved using the `ping` command, which sends packets containing the source IP to the remote server. In this way, the `ping` command functions as a key, temporarily unlocking SSH:22 for the client's IP address.

### Solution:
The key must have a certain level of security and not be easily guessed. Here's how we create the key: 
- Use the `length` module to match the total packet length.
- Define a custom ping packet size.
- Define a custom number of ping attempts.
- Ensure the login to SSH:22 occurs within a specified time.

To summarize, the server temporarily grants SSH:22 access only if it receives a ping packet of a specific size and count within a certain time frame.

### Implementation:
Send a ping packet of 1050 bytes, five times from any client. The server will then automatically open SSH:22 access for this client for 30 seconds.

**Note:** ICMP packet structure: IP header (20 bytes) + ICMP header (8 bytes) + Data (1050 bytes)

**Calculation:** 
The server receives an ICMP packet of total size 20 + 8 + 1050 = 1078 bytes.

**Rules:** 
We need five rules in total:

```bash
# Rule 1: Accept ping packets of 1078 bytes and record the source IP in sshKeyList.
# -A INPUT: Append this rule to the INPUT chain
# -p icmp: Match ICMP protocol packets
# -m icmp --icmp-type 8: Match ICMP echo request (ping)
# -m length --length 1078: Match packets with a total length of 1078 bytes
# -m recent --name sshKeyList --set: Add the source IP to the recent list named sshKeyList
# -j ACCEPT: Accept the packet
iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -m icmp --icmp-type 8 -m length --length 1078 -m recent --name sshKeyList --set -j ACCEPT

# Rule 2: If hit count reaches 6 within 30 seconds, drop new SSH:22 connections.
# -A INPUT: Append this rule to the INPUT chain
# -p tcp: Match TCP protocol packets
# -m tcp --dport 22 --syn: Match TCP packets destined for port 22 (SSH) with the SYN flag set (new connections)
# -m recent --name sshKeyList --rcheck --seconds 30 --hitcount 6: Check if the source IP is in the sshKeyList with at least 6 hits within the last 30 seconds
# -j DROP: Drop the packet
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 --syn -m recent --name sshKeyList --rcheck --seconds 30 --hitcount 6 -j DROP

# Rule 3: If hit count reaches 5 within 30 seconds, accept new SSH:22 connections.
# -A INPUT: Append this rule to the INPUT chain
# -p tcp: Match TCP protocol packets
# -m tcp --dport 22 --syn: Match TCP packets destined for port 22 (SSH) with the SYN flag set (new connections)
# -m recent --name sshKeyList --rcheck --seconds 30 --hitcount 5: Check if the source IP is in the sshKeyList with exactly 5 hits within the last 30 seconds
# -j ACCEPT: Accept the packet
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 --syn -m recent --name sshKeyList --rcheck --seconds 30 --hitcount 5 -j ACCEPT

# Rule 4: Accept established connections.
# -A INPUT: Append this rule to the INPUT chain
# -m state --state ESTABLISHED: Match packets that are part of an already established connection
# -j ACCEPT: Accept the packet
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

# Rule 5: Default drop rule.
# -A INPUT: Append this rule to the INPUT chain
# -j DROP: Drop all packets that do not match previous rules
iptables -A INPUT -j DROP

```

### Testing:

**Windows:**
Default ping attempts: 4 times. Default packet size: 32 bytes.

```bash
C:\Users\Administrator>ping 192.168.137.66 -l 1050 -n 5

Pinging 192.168.137.66 with 1050 bytes of data:
Reply from 192.168.137.66: bytes=1050 time<1ms TTL=64
Reply from 192.168.137.66: bytes=1050 time<1ms TTL=64
Reply from 192.168.137.66: bytes=1050 time<1ms TTL=64
Reply from 192.168.137.66: bytes=1050 time<1ms TTL=64
Reply from 192.168.137.66: bytes=1050 time<1ms TTL=64
```

**Linux:**
Default ping attempts: unlimited. Default packet size: 56 bytes.

```bash
[root@martin ~]# ping 192.168.137.66 -s 1050 -c 5
PING 192.168.137.66 (192.168.137.66) 1050(1078) bytes of data.
1058 bytes from 192.168.137.66: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.711 ms
1058 bytes from 192.168.137.66: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=1.00 ms
1058 bytes from 192.168.137.66: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.629 ms
1058 bytes from 192.168.137.66: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=1.32 ms
1058 bytes from 192.168.137.66: icmp_seq=5 ttl=64 time=1.02 ms
```

Once done, you can log in via SSH (within 30 seconds, so act quickly). With the `--state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT` rule in place, you don't have to worry about being disconnected. Secure remote SSH access management is that simple!
