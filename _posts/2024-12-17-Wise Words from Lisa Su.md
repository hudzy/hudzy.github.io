> Have confidence and take a chance. Don’t worry about failure. Sit in meeting rooms, say what’s on your mind, and volunteer. Run toward problems. Work hard every day on something that is really important. Look for the hardest problem to solve and volunteer to help. Learn a lot in the process, distinguish yourself, and face mistakes without fear. Get up the next day, keep going, and learn through the process.

- Lisa Su, AMD's CEO
